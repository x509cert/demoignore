Spike Milligan Poem

'twas midinight in the school room and every desk was shut,
when suddenly from the alphabet was hear a loud, 'tut,tut!'
said A to B, I don't like C, his manners are alack
for all I ever see of C is a semi-circular back.

Said D to B, I disagree, I have never seen C so,
from where I stand he seems to be an uncompleted O.

C was vexed..
